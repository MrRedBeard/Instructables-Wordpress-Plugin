# Instructables-Wordpress-Plugin
A WordPress plugin that allows you to display Instructables on your WordPress site.

Simple WordPress Plugin that allows you to display Instructables as if they were blog posts or a project gallery. You can list projects by category, author, keywords, etc. 

Long over due posting of this plugin here and updating it to the latest version of WordPress.

Example of running code can be found here http://www.mickred.com/redbeard/redbeard-on-instructables-com/
