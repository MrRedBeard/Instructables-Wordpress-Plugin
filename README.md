# Instructables-Wordpress-Plugin
A WordPress plugin that allows you to display Instructables on your WordPress site.

Simple WordPress Plugin that allows you to display Instructables as if they were blog posts or a project gallery. You can list projects by category, author, keywords, etc. 

Long over due posting of this plugin here and updating it to the latest version of WordPress.

To display instructables use the following short codes
NEW!! Add tileview="true" to display a tile of images and titles.

Display a user's projects:
[instructablesUP username="MrRedBeard" num="2" thumb="true" tileview="false"]

Display a list of projects by keyword:
[instructablesKW keyword="tent" num="3" thumb="true" tileview="false"]

Display a list of a User's favorite projects:
